# AI Final Project
The project consists of analising a dataset using machine learning concepts.
Project's Must:
1. Use of KNN, Decision Tree and K-Means algorithms
2. Data cleaning and pre-processing (removal of missing data NaN, transformation of categorical data and normalization)
3. Class balance
4. Sampling by stratified k-fold cross-validation (10 folds)
5. Consider a version of the dataset without the income class attribute; Perform data clustering based on the K-Means algorithm. For this, use the Age and education columns (for education, consider a data transformation step with LabelEncoder).
